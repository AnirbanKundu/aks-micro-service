# Azure Kubernetes Micro Service 
This repository will walk you through on how to setup your AKS cluster, create your own Azure Registry, create a service principal so that AKS cluster can access the Azure Registry.
Once the RBAC is created, you can upload your local Docker Image to the Registry. And then instruct AKS to deploy image.
